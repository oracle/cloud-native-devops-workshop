# Lab 200 - Integration Cloud Service

---

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **ICS Deep dive** workshop. 

In this lab, you will learn how to create a basic 'hello world' echo service. 

Please direct comments to: John VanSant (john.vansant@oracle.com)

## Objectives

- Create your first mapping 

## Required Artifacts

- The following lab and an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.

# Part 1: Create a REST Connection
----

In this first part of the lab, we will create a connection :

Let’s start by logging into the Oracle Cloud account using your allocated user (demo.user1..10)  

**NOTE:** All the screenshots uses the _demo.user10_ account. 

### **STEP 1**: Login to your Oracle Cloud account

---
***NOTE:*** the **User Name and Password** values will be given to you by your instructor.

- You will be presented with the ICS home page. 

### **STEP 2:**	Create a Connection

---

**2.1** Click on the **Connection** section

**2.2** Click on **New Connection**

![](images/200/image003.png) 

**2.3** Select the **REST** Connection, by either doing a search, or by scrolling down to the **REST** connection, by clicking on the **Select** button of the **REST** connection.

**2.4** Fill in the information for the new connection 

- **Name** in the form of _UserXX REST_ where XX is the number in your allocated user.
- **Role** _Trigger_ since we going to use the connection as a trigger to start the integration

>**Note** The default security configuration is set to **Basic Authentication**, which >by the way, is the only option available for REST trigger connections. When invoking >the trigger, we will use our ICS username/password. 

**2.6** Click on **Test**

**1.7** Fill in the required values on **Basic Info** page, and click **Next >**

- **What do you want to call your endpoint?** _echo_
- **What is the endpoint's relative resource URI** _/echo_
- **What action does the endpoint perform?** _POST_
- **Configure a request payload for this endpoint** _Checked_
- **Configure for this endpoint to receive a response** _Checked_
- **Configure CORS (Cross Origin Resource Sharing)** _Checked_

**1.10** Click on **Next >** to move on to the _Response_

![](images/200/image021.png)

**1.11** Select **JSON Sample**, and click on **<<< inline >>>** to enter sample JSON
- Now you can see your connection in the configured connection list

**1.12** Enter the following JSON into the **Enter Sample JSON**, and click **Ok**

```javascript
{
    "return": "String to echo"
}
```
