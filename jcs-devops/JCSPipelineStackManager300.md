## Introduction

This is the third of several labs that are part of the **DevOps JCS Pipeline using Oracle Stack Manger workshop**. This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Java Cloud Service (JCS) project that goes through Infrastructure as Code and deployment of a Struts application.

In the first lab (100), the Project Manager created a new project in the Developer Cloud Service, created and assigned tasks to the developers of this application. In this lab, you will assume the persona of Java Developer who will be tasked with making enhancements to the Alpha Office Product Catalog UI.

***To log issues***, click here to go to the [github oracle](https://github.com/oracle/cloud-native-devops-workshop/issues/new) repository issue submission form.

## Objectives
- Access Developer Cloud Service
- Import configuration from external Git Repository
- Import Project into Eclipse
- Setup Build and Deployment of UI using Developer Cloud Service and Java Cloud Service

## Required Artifacts
- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor. You will need to download and install latest version of Eclipse or use supplied compute VM.

# Create Initial Git Repository for Alpha Office Catalog UI

## Create Initial Git Repository

Although you will remain connected to the Oracle Cloud using the user account you were provided, you are to take on the Persona of ***John Dunbar*** as you perform the following steps. John is our Java developer who will be making the enhancements to our product catalog UI.

    **Enter the URL:** `https://github.com/pcdavies/AlphaOfficeProductCatalogUI.git`

    ![](images/300/Picture300-5.png)

- You have now created a new GIT repository based on an existing repository.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-6.png)

## Create Default Build for and Deployment Process

### **STEP 3:** Create Alpha Office Product Catalog UI Build Process

Now that we have the source code in our managed GIT repository, we need to create a build process that will be triggered whenever a commit is made to the master branch. We will set up a Maven build process in this section.

- On navigation panel click **Build** to access the build page and click **New Job**.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-7.png)

- In the New Job popup enter **Alpha Office Product Catalog UI** for the Job Name, and then click **Save**.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-8.png)

- You are now placed into the job configuration screen.        

    ![](images/300/Picture300-9.png)

- On the Main tab on the Configure Build screen change the **JDK** drop down to **JDK8**.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-10.png)

- Click the **Source Control** tab. Click **Git** and select **AlphaOfficeProductCatalogUI.git** from the drop down.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-11.png)

- Click the **Triggers** tab. Select **Based on SCM polling schedule**.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-12.png)    

- Click the **Build Steps** tab. Click **Add Build Step**, and select **Invoke Maven 3**.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-13.png)

- In the Maven Build Step set the following:

    **Goal**: `clean -Dmaven.test.skip=true install` 
    
    (Note: This new Goal will allow integration tests to be run after the deployment of the application)
    
    **POM File**: `AlphaProducts/pom.xml`  

    ![](images/300/Picture300-14.png)

- Click the **Post Build** tab. Check **Archive the artifacts** and enter `**/target/*` for the Files to Archive.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-15.png)

- Click **Save** to complete the configuration.

- Click the **Build Now** button to start the build. This will trigger for the build to be placed in the build queue.

- Click on the **Jobs Overview** link to return to the jobs dashboard. 

    ![](images/300/Picture300-16.5.png)

- It is possible that the Job will show in the Queue. Wait, as it may take 30 seconds or more, but the status will change indicating that the job is building as is shown below:

    ![](images/300/Picture300-16.6.png)

- Once the build has completed, you should see a green check next to the build name.  Wait for the build to complete before continuing to the next step, as we need the build artifact to complete the deployment configuration.

### **STEP 4:** Retrieve Public IP of JCS Instance for Deployment

Before we can configure deployment of our application we need to make note of the IP for our JCS instance. The **Alpha01A-JCS** instance has already been provisioned.

- Switch over to browser tab for cloud services. Click on the far left navigation icon and select **Oracle Java Cloud Service**.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-18.png)

- The Java Cloud Service console shows all the provisioned instances of JCS.  You should see the instance **Alpha01A-JCS** which has been provisioned in advance.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-19.png)

- Click on **Alpha01A-JCS** to view the details of the service. Copy down the **Public IP** to be used later in the lab.

    ![](images/300/Picture300-20.png)

- Expland the **Load Balancer** section and copy down the **Public IP** to be used later in the lab.
