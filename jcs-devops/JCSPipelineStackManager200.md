Update: March 3, 2017

## Introduction

This is the second of several labs that are part of the **DevOps JCS Pipeline using Oracle Stack Manger workshop**. This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Java Cloud Service (JCS) project that goes through Infrastructure as Code and deployment of a Struts application.

In the first lab (100), the Project Manager created a new project in the Developer Cloud Service, created and assigned tasks to the developers of this application. In this lab, you will assume the persona of Operations, who will be tasked with creating an Infrastructure as Code pipeline for the provisioning of Alpha Office Java Cloud Service (JCS) environment.

## Create Default Build for Template Upload

**Oracle Cloud Stack Manager** is a feature of Oracle Cloud that allows for the provisioning of multiple services within the Oracle Cloud. In order to build and deploy their applications, businesses often require sophisticated environments that consist of multiple, integrated cloud services. Consider a development environment whose needs include a Java application server along with a relational database. Provisioning each of these services for every member of your development team is time consuming and error prone, regardless of whether you’re using service consoles or REST APIs to provision the services. Oracle Cloud Stack Manager uses templates to provision a group of services (called a stack) and in the correct order.

### **STEP 3:** Create Template Update Build Process

Now that we have the configuration code in our managed GIT repository, we need to create a build process that will be triggered whenever a commit is made to the master branch. This build process will trigger any time the Alpha Office Stack template is modified and upload a new version via REST to the Oracle Cloud.

- On navigation panel click **Build** to access the build page and click **New Job**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-8.png)

- In the New Job popup enter **Infrastructure Update Template** for the Job Name, and then click **Save**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-9.png)

- You are now placed into the job configuration screen.        

    ![](images/200/Picture200-10.png)

- Click the **Source Control** tab. Click **Git** and select **JCSStackAlphaInfrastructure.git** from the drop down. Expand **Advanced Git Settings** and enter `Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template.yaml`

    ![](images/200/Picture200-11.png)

- Click the **Triggers** tab. Select **Based on SCM polling schedule**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-15.png)    

- Click the **Build Steps** tab. Click **Add Build Step**, and select **Execute shell**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-12.png)

- Enter the following REST call for the **Execute Shell Command:**

```
curl --request POST \
  --user <opc username>:<opc password> \
  --url https://psm.europe.oraclecloud.com/paas/api/v1.1/instancemgmt/<OPC Identity Domain>/templates/cst/instances \
  --header 'X-ID-TENANT-NAME: <OPC Identity Domain>' \
  --header 'content-type: multipart/form-data' \
  --form template=@Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template.yaml
```

**Note:** Replace <OPC > with your OPC credentials

![](images/200/Picture200-13.5.png)

![](images/200/Picture200-13.png)

- Click **Save** to complete the configuration.

- Click the **Build Now** button to start the build. This will trigger for the build to be placed in the queue and should start shortly.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-14.png)

- Once the build has completed you should see a green check.  

    ![](images/200/Picture200-16.png)

- If you want to view the results or debug a failure click on the **Console** link.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-17.png)

### **STEP 4:** Verify Template Upload to Oracle Cloud

- Now we will navigate to the Oracle Stack Manager console to view the newly uploaded template. Click back on the browser tab that you launched the Developer Console. Click on the far left navigation icon ![](images/Menu.png) and select **Database**

    ![](images/200/Picture200-18.png)

- Click on the far left navigation icon and select **Oracle Cloud Stack**

    ![](images/200/Picture200-19.png)

- From this service console you are able to manage and monitor all your **Stacks** and **Templates**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-20.png)

- Click on **Templates**. You should see your newly uploaded template **Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template** along with the default templates supplied by Oracle.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-21.png)

- Click on **Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template** to view details about your template. The **Topology** gives you a graphical view of the Stack.  Our template has **JCS**, **DBCS** and **Storage Cloud** (backupContainer). If you expand the **Template** section you can view the entire template file.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-22.png)

## Create Default Build for Stack Create

### **STEP 5:** Create Stack Create Build Process

Now we will create a build process that will provision a new Oracle Stack every time a change is made to a configuration file.  This File will define the need parameters to create unique environment using Oracle Stack Manager based on the newly uploaded template **Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template**.

- Back in the Developer Cloud Service, click **Build**, followed by clicking **New Job**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-26.png)

- In the New Job popup enter **Infrastructure Create Stack** for the Job Name, and then click **Save**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-27.png)

- You are now placed into the job configuration screen.        

    ![](images/200/Picture200-28.png)

- Click the **Source Control** tab. Click **Git** and select **JCSStackAlphaInfrastructure.git** from the drop down. Expand **Advanced Git Settings** and enter `JCSBuild.conf`

    ![](images/200/Picture200-29.png)

- Click the **Triggers** tab. Select **Based on SCM polling schedule**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-30.png)    

- Click the **Build Steps** tab. Click **Add Build Step**, and select **Execute shell**.

    ![](images/200/Picture200-31.png)

- Enter the following REST call for the **Execute Shell Command:**

```
source ./JCSBuild.conf
curl --request POST \
  --user <OPC username>:<OPC password> \
  --url https://psm.europe.oraclecloud.com/paas/api/v1.1/instancemgmt/<OPC Identity Domain>/services/stack/instances \
  --header 'X-ID-TENANT-NAME: <OPC Identity Domain>' \
  --header 'content-type: multipart/form-data' \
  --form name=$ServiceName \
  --form template=Alpha-JCS-DBCS-Template \
  --form 'parameterValues={"commonPwd":"'"$CommonPassword"'", "backupStorageContainer":"'"$BackupStorageContainer"'", "cloudStoragePassword":"<OPC password>"}}'
```

**Note:** Replace <OPC > with your OPC credentials

![](images/200/Picture200-32.5.png)
