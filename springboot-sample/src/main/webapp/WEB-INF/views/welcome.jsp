    About <span>Oracle Application Container Cloud</span>
  </h1>
  <div>
    <p>
      <span>Oracle Application Container Cloud</span> includes <span>Oracle
        Java SE Cloud Service</span>, which lets you deploy Java applications to
      the Oracle Cloud, and <span>Oracle Node Cloud Service</span>, which
      lets you deploy Node.js applications to the Oracle Cloud.
    </p>
    <p>When you deploy your application you specify the kind of
      application, whether it's Node.js or Java. You don't have to choose
      when you subscribe; both are available when you deploy. Your
      application runs in a Docker container.</p>

    <p>
      The key features of <span>Oracle Application Container Cloud</span>
      are:
    <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
      <li>
        <p>Pre-configured environment for Java and Node.js applications.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Java SE advanced features such as Java Flight Recorder, Java
          Mission Control, advanced memory management, and ongoing and timely
          security updates.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Open platform that supports all Java frameworks and
          containers such as Spring, Play, Tomcat, and Jersey.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You can also use Java Virtual Machine (JVM) based languages
          such as JRuby. Any language that uses the Java Virtual Machine can
          be run on this service.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Enterprise-grade support from Oracle.</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition, you can choose to integrate with other Oracle cloud
      services. You may develop your application on your local system, or
      you can use <span>Oracle Developer Cloud Service</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to store and retrieve data, you may use <span>Oracle
        Storage Cloud Service</span> - a subscription is included. You may also
      subscribe to <span>Oracle Database Cloud Service</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      For communication, you may subscribe to <span>Oracle Messaging
        Cloud Service</span>. Your application will communicate with that service
      via its REST API, so no special security configuration is necessary.
