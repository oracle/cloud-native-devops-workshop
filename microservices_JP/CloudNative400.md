## Objectives
- Access Developer Cloud Service
- Complete Sprint
- Run Backlog and Sprint Reports
- Review Administrative Tasks


## Required Artifacts
- The following lab requires an Oracle Public Cloud account that will be supplied by your instructor.


# Close the Sprint

## Connect to the Develop Cloud Service

### **STEP 1**: Select the Agile Dashboard

- This Lab assumes that you completed Lab 100, 200, and 300 and are still connected to the Oracle Cloud, that you're still in the Developer cloud Service Dashboard, and you're viewing the "Twitter Feed Marketing Project". If for some reason that is not the case, follow the first several Steps of Lab 100 to once again view the Developer Cloud Service Console.

- Although you will remain connected to the Oracle Cloud using the user account you were provided, you are to take on the Persona of ***Lisa Jones*** as you perform the following steps.

- Click on the **Sprint Report** tab. In this lab, the results will be skewed because the Sprint was completed in a single day. However, the dotted line shows the starting point, and the red line shows the current remaining points. Normally this would step down towards the end of the sprint.
