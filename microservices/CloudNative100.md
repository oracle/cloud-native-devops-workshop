## Introduction

This is the first of several labs that are part of the **Oracle Public Cloud DevOps Cloud Native Microservices workshop.** This workshop will walk you through the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) for a Cloud Native project that will create and use several Microservices.

Although you will login as a single user, you will take on 3 Personas during the workshop. The **Project Manager Persona** will create the projects, add tasks and features to be worked on, and assign tasks to developers.  The Project Manager will then start the initial sprint. The Java Developer persona will develop a new twitter feed service that will allow for retrieval and filtering of twitter data. The **JavaScript Developer** persona will develop a new Twitter Marketing UI that will display the twitter data to allow for analysis.  During this workshop, you will get exposure to Oracle Developer Cloud Service and Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.

# Create Agile Board

## Create Agile Board and Initial Sprint

### Developer Cloud Service Agile Page Overview

Before you start using the Agile methodology in Oracle Developer Cloud Service, it is important that you know the following key components of the Agile page.

- **Board** – A Board is used to display and update issues of the project. When you create a Board, you associate it with an Issue Query. The Board shows Issues returned by the Query.
You can either use a Board created by a team member, or create your own Board. You can create as many Boards as you like.
- **Sprint** – A Sprint is a short duration (usually, a week or two) during which your team members try to implement a product component.
You add the product component related issues to a Sprint. When you start working on a product component, you start (or activate) the related Sprints. To update issues using a Sprint, you must first activate the Sprint and add the Sprint to the Active Sprints view.
- **Backlog view** – Lists all Issues returned by the Board’s Query. The view also displays all active and inactive Sprints of the Board, and the sprints from other Boards that contain Issues matching the Board’s Query.
Each Sprint lists issues that are added to it. The Backlog section (the last section of the Backlog page) lists all open issues that are not part of any Sprint yet. The Backlog view does not show the resolved and closed Issues.
- **Active Sprints view** – Lists all active Sprints of the Board and enables you to update an Issue status simply by dragging and dropping it to the respective status columns.
- **Reports view** – select the Burndown Chart tab to display the amount of work left to do in a Sprint or use the Sprint Report tab to list open and completed Issues of a Sprint.

### **STEP 9**: Create Agile Board

- Click **Agile** on the Left Side Menu to display a page listing all existing Boards

    ![](images/100/Picture100-23.png)

- Click **New Board** and enter the following data. When done click **Create**.

  **Name:** `Microservices`

  **Estimation:** `Story Points`

    ![](images/100/Picture100-24.png)

### **STEP 10**: Create Sprint
- We will now create our first Sprint. Click **New Sprint**. Enter the following data and click **OK.**

    **Name:** `Sprint 1 - Initial Development`

    **Story Points:** `6`

    ![](images/100/Picture100-25.png)

### **STEP 11**:	Add Backlog Issues to Sprint

- Next, we want to add the backlog issues to the newly created sprint. **Drag and drop** the **4 issues** one at a time upward onto the **Sprint 1** section. This will add the issues to the sprint.

    ![](images/100/Picture100-26.png)

    ![](images/100/Picture100-27.png)

## Customize Agile Board

### **STEP 12**: Customize Board

In the following step you will customize an Agile Board, and add a new Progress State. If you desire more information about States and Conditions, this [Link](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/cloud/developer/AgileDevelopment/AgileDevelopment.html) will provide a tutorial: 

- Now we will show you how you can customize your board. In the right hand side click **Board -> Configure**

    ![](images/100/Picture100-28.png)

  **Note**: Before we create a new progress state, we want to un-assign some of the conditions that will be used in the new state. You can’t add new conditions or remove conditions, however, you can redefine progress states to suit your project’s needs and move conditions from one state to another. A large number of conditions are assigned to the Completed state by default.

- Click on **Progress States** then click **Completed** state. In the lower left panel of the window, scroll down the conditions and select all the **RESOLVED conditions**.  Click ![](images/100/PictureGreater.png) to move them over to Unassigned Conditions panel

    ![](images/100/Picture100-29.png)

- Click **New Progress State**.  Change **Name** to **Verify Code**. We will use this new State for performing QA and Testing.

    ![](images/100/Picture100-30.png)

- Highlight all the **RESOLVED** unassigned conditions, and click ![](images/100/PictureLess.png) to move them over to the Conditions column.

    ![](images/100/Picture100-31.png)

- With **Verify Code** highlighted, click ![](images/100/PictureUpArrow.png) to move **Verify Code** above the Completed Process State. This is an important step, since it will dictate the sequence in which tasks  progress.  

    ![](images/100/Picture100-32.png)

- Click **Save** to persist change.

    ![](images/100/Picture100-33.png)

### **STEP 13**: Start Sprint

- Click the **Start Sprint** button.

- Leave the defaults and click **Start**

    ![](images/100/Picture100-34.png)

- Now click on **Active Sprints** to view the Sprint Dashboard

    ![](images/100/Picture100-35.png)

- Click on the **Reports** button to view the Burndown and Sprint reports.

    ![](images/100/Picture100-36.png)

- You are now ready to move to the next lab.
