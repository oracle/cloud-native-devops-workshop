# How to Prepare for the BlackJack Hands-On-Lab

In this hands-on lab, you will build and deploy a blackjack RESTful
Cloud Application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service, using
Oracle Developer Cloud Service. The sample application is a blackjack
REST service with an HTML5 client. You will start by building a simple
Helloworld application using Git and Maven locally and push the
application to Oracle Developer Cloud Service. Next, you will deploy the
application to Oracle Application Container Cloud Service.

The result is you will learn to take an application developed locally
and deploy it to Oracle Cloud.

You use your laptop and your Oracle Cloud trial account to perform the lab and run the blackjack card game.
