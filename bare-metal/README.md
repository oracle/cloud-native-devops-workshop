# BMCS_HOL

## Overview

Oracle has built a Bare Metal Cloud Services (BMCS) platform for running Oracle workloads and cloud native applications. In this hands on lab, we will walk through building a cloud native application stack on BMCS. The purpose of this lab is to get familiar with Bare Metal Cloud primitives. At the end of this lab, you will be familiar with creating a virtual cloud network, launching an instance, accessing the instance and installing the MEAN stack. For this lab, we will go through installing and running MEAN (MongoDB, Express, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack that is used widely by many applications.   

## Pre-Requisites 
•	Bare Metal Cloud Services account credentials (User, Password, and Tenant)

•	SSH key generated and available
  
### SSH key generation
If you already have a public / private key pair, you can use that for SSH. If you need to generate an SSH key, refer for additional doc here: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Generating-Your-SSH-Public-Key
